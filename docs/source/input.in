The input variables:

dt : the time-step in seconds.
dt_btp : the time-step in seconds.
time_initial : initial time (can be nonzero if it is a restart).
time_final : final time (can be in seconds, minutes, hours, or days, 
			depending on the test case).

time_restart : time at which restart files are produced. The units of 
			   time depend on the test case as mentioned previously. 
			   The restart only works for 'txt' outputs at the moment.

cd_mlswe : is the bottom friction value.

method_visc : is for the use of viscosity term. If it is 0, that means
			  no use, otherwise, the viscosity solver is used.

visc_mlswe : is the value of the viscosity in the Laplacian term.

max_shear_dz : is used to discretize the vertical diffusion or 
			   friction between layer terms.

dg_integ_exact : a logical flag that turns off and on whether you
				 want to use 2N-1 quadrature points or 2N+1 for DG 
				 integrations.

dump_data : a logical flag that turns off and on the dumping 
			of the simulation data to a file

test_case : is the specific test case.  More on this in ``tests section``.

ti_method :  is the time-integration method (only the 
			 predictor-corrector is available now).

ti_method_btp : is the time-integration method for the barotropic equations

kstages : number of Runge-Kutta stages if ti_method='rk'. 
		  If ti_method='rk35' then the value of kstages 
		  does not matter.

fname_root : the root name of the output data. All data files 
             for this run will have the prefix defined by fname_root.

out_type : defines the type of output file.

lprint_diagnostics : a logical flag that turns off and on the printing. 
					 For scalability studies we turn off the printing
					 to the screen.

lcheck_conserved: a logical flag that turns off and on the 
				  compuation of mass conservation.
