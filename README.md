# h-NUMO
Hydrostatic version of the Non-hydrostatic Model of the Ocean

We implement h-NUMO in the Galerkin Numerical Modeling Environment(GNuME) (Giraldo, 2016) framework. The GNuME framework uses an arbitrary polynomial basis function expansion and offers a choice of continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods Abdi and Giraldo (2016). The framework was previously used to construct the Non-Hydrostatic Unified Model of the Ocean Kopera et al. (2023), and we call the current implementation of multilayer shallow water equations h-NUMO to signify the hydrostatic aspect of the
model.
