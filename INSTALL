h-NUMO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Sometimes simple make does not work, and you need to compile p4est (and possibly Metis) manually.
Here is how to compile h-NUMO, assuming Metis is already installed and linked

1) Compile p4est by going to p4est directory and typing
./get_p4est_install

2) Export path to the p4est library
To make sure this is exported every time you log-in, put the following line to ~/.bash_profile file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH:<path_to_h-NUMO>/p4est/local/lib

where <path_to_h-NUMO> is the location where you have installed h-NUMO

Just in case type source ~./bash_profile, and it is not a bad idea to include this source command in your run scripts

3) Compile NUMO by going to its directory and typing:
make hnumo (check the config.user if you want to compile on different platforms)
