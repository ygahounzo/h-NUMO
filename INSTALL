NUMO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR R2 (and possibly other machines)
Sometimes simple make does not work, and you need to compile p4est (and possibly Metis) manually.
Here is how to compile NUMO on R2, assuming Metis is already installed and linked

1) Compile p4est by going to p4est directory and typing
./get_p4est_install r2

2) Export path to the p4est library
To make sure this is exported every time you log-in, put the following line to ~/.bash_profile file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH:<path_to_numo>/p4est/local/lib

where <path_to_numo> is the location where you have installed NUMO

Just in case type source ~./bash_profile, and it is not a bad idea to include this source command in your run scripts

3) Compile NUMO by going to its directory and typing:
make r2
